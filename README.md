# portola

Transforms folders and images into a fast, modern portfolio website. Focus on content and styling instead of worrying about how it all works.

## directory structure

Here is an example of how a portola project would look.

- pages/ pages in here describe the site content
- templates/ each page lists a template that is in here
- finished_site/ this is where the finished site shows up
- .gitignore
- package.json
